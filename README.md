# Aeolus 

Aeolus will be built around the code for a phpBB3 forum.  The initial commit features only the phpBB source code, but future commits will see the website itself added.

For reference, this seems to be a good source of directions for adding pages to the site:
https://www.phpbb.com/support/docs/en/3.0/kb/article/add-a-new-custom-page-to-phpbb/

Once there is original code to run, this file should include directions for running Aeolus locally and a list of features/missing features.
